# Fleximasters
## Some showcase of my group and individual work done for NTU's FlexiMasters in Business and Financial Analytics
### Throughout the modules, we covered Tableau, MySQL, KNIME, Orange, ChatGPT, snatchbot, etc...
#### As much as I would like to showcase many items, I need to be mindful of copyright / school's IP etc, and also to be careful not to leak answers for the future batches. Hence, I will only show a select few as appropriate.


###### Tableau showcase for showing HDB resale prices trend. Our group's framing focused on elderly looking to downgrade HDB flats.
